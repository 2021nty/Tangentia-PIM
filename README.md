# Tangentia-PIM
One of the biggest issues facing the Retail, CPG and Distribution industry today is the inadequacy of the Master Data Management modules within their ERP systems. Most ERP system -master data modules have probably 5-6 fields for Master Data - Item/ SKU Name, ITEM/SKU short description, ITEM/SKU short description, UPC code and maybe a few more. With the boundaries blurring between traditional Retail, CPG and Distribution and with the advent of Multi Channel eCommerce, the need for clean and rich product information is the need of the hour. Today at most companies, this information is stored on paper or in a number of spreadsheets. Some of this information exists in the ERP/ Accounting application but there is no common repository or ‘vault’ for item information that is reliable, accurate and comprehensive. A PIM does exactly that- ‘Manage Item information in a central repository accurately and reliably with role based multiple access and data sync capabilities’. A PIM is quickly becoming an important and critical component of the IT infrastructure at most progressive companies. PIM’s have driven significant cost savings at companies that used to rely on paper, spreadsheets and legacy databases to manage their item information.
